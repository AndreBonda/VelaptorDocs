# Intro to Velaptor

Velaptor is an open-source framework for building high-performant, high-quality, cross-platform 2D games using C#/dotnet.

:::info
[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-difference-between-a-framework-and-a-library-bd133054023f/) is a good explanation of a framework vs a library.

## Overview

Velaptor focuses on developing your game.  What this means is that instead of dealing with low-level details such as writing low level
code for rendering graphics, keyboard and mouse input, sound, and other common things required by games, you can just focus on writing your game.

Writing these things from scratch can take hours when all you want to do is create.  This is where Velaptor can help!!
:::info Quick Note
Velaptor is currently still in preview and under development.  Though you can create games with Velaptor in
its current state and it is always improving, further work still needs to be completed to get Velaptor to run on
on other platforms such as Linux, Android, and iOS. 

This means that currently, Velaptor applications can only run on Windows.  
As of right now, there are no plans to support MacOS.

### Single Codebase

The goal of Velaptor is to be able to write 2D games from a single code base and to run them on multiple platforms.
This means you do not have to maintain multiple languages and tech stacks to be able to run your game on the desired platforms.

### Performant

Velaptor has been built with performance in mind as much as possible and will always strive to keep
things as performant as possible.

### Simple

Creating games can be some of the most complicated and resource-demanding applications out there.  Our goal
is to try and make creating games as simple and straight forward as possible.  This means we are willing to change
the API if this means the gain in simplicity is substantial while keeping performance into account.

### Reliable

We strive to make Velaptor as reliable and free of bugs as possible.  We all know that there is no such thing as
100% bug-free software.  But that does not mean we can't strive for it!!
Velaptor is highly tested.  We maintain a very high level of code coverage to make sure that nothing slips through
the cracks and are always maintaining and improving our unit tests.

We have achieved this by designing the Velaptor architecture to be loosely coupled as well as making use of the observable
pattern and dependency injection to make the code as testable as possible.

Manual testing is also performed using a custom testing application that is regularly maintained to catch anything
that unit tests do not catch.

:::note A quick note about unit testing
Unit tests are not the end-all-be-all solution for reliable bug-free software.  We do not strive to have
100% code coverage for the goal of having 100% code coverage.  There are areas of Velaptor that _**CANNOT**_ be tested
due to some of the interaction with low-level pieces of the framework such as [OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/), sound,
and other low-level operating system interactions.  These pieces are abstracted away to achieve high testability
on the Velaptor side.

This is one reason why we do lots of manual testing to cover the areas that unit tests cannot.

## Learn how to contribute

The Velaptor project is run and maintained by [Calvin Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/KDCoder) and [Kristen Wilkinson](https://twitter.com/kswilky).  We work on this full-time
and work hard to make this project as well as all of the [KinsonDigital](https://github.com/KinsonDigital) projects in working order.  Any open-source developer will tell you
that maintaining open-source projects are a ton of work.ðŸ¥±
